# Social Security Fund Model

## Overview
This project explores an alternative approach to Social Security by modeling a fund where workers contribute, investments grow, and retirees receive payouts. The goal is to determine if a more efficient system could be designed that requires lower contributions while maintaining sustainability.

## Status
This project is currently a work in progress. Features and calculations may change as the model evolves.

## Getting Started
The main entry point for this project is `main.py`. Running this script from `src` will execute the core calculations and simulations. Adjust any of the values in the `Constants` section to adjust the performance of the model.
